# Week challenges week 1 
- (Tuesday)
1. Create an explanation about Interpreted and Compiled programming Languages. 
    - Compiled languages: are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute. As a result, they tend to be faster and more efficient to execute than interpreted languages. <br>
    <strong>Example: watching a movie fully dubbed.</strong><br>
    
    - Interpreted languages: are: Ran through a program line by line and execute each command. Interpreted languages were once significantly slower than compiled languages. But, with the development of just-in-time compilation, that gap is shrinking.<br>
    <strong>Example: watching a movie with subtitles (understanding is a bit slower).</strong><br>
    <br> 

2. Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?
    - Java: Is first compiled into bytecode which JRE can understand. ByteCode is then interpreted by the JVM making it as interpreted language.
    <strong>(both complied and interpreted language)</strong><br>
    <br>
3. Pseudocode Currency Converter exercise.
    - START <br> 
    Amount (USD) <-- GET <br> 
    BTC rate <--  GET FROM(https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/)<br> 
    Total <-- Amount (usd) * BTC rate <br> 
    PRINT  Total <br> 
    END
4. Learn about High and Low level languages.
    - <strong>A Low Level programing language</strong> is considered machine language, and itÂ´s how a program can comunicate with the computer without being compiled nor interpreted. they are very diffucult for humans to understand.

    - <strong>A high level programming Language</strong> is easy to read, write and maintain they are human friendly, As it's more understandable.

1. Your date of birth in the matrix? exercise
    - 1994 -> 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 8 + 2 <br>

    1994-1024=970<br>
    970-512=458<br>
    458-256=202<br>
    202-128=74<br>
    74-64=10<br>
    10-8=2<br>
    2-2=0<br>


    1024 - 512 - 256 - 128 - 64 - 32 - 16 - 8 - 4 - 2 - 1<br> 
    1  ------ 1 ---- 1 ---- 1 -- 1 --- 0 --- 0 - 1 - 0 - 1 - 0<br> 

    <strong>R/1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0</strong> <br>
