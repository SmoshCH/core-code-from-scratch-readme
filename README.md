# Week challenges week 1 
- (Tuesday)
1. Create an explanation about Interpreted and Compiled programming Languages. 
    - Compiled languages: are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute. As a result, they tend to be faster and more efficient to execute than interpreted languages. <br>
    <strong>Example: watching a movie fully dubbed.</strong><br>
    <br> 
    - Compiled languages: are: Ran through a program line by line and execute each command. Interpreted languages were once significantly slower than compiled languages. But, with the development of just-in-time compilation, that gap is shrinking.<br>
    <strong>Example: watching a movie with subtitles (understanding is a bit slower).</strong><br>
    <br> 

2. Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?
    - Java: Is first compiled into bytecode which JRE can understand. ByteCode is then interpreted by the JVM making it as interpreted language.
    <strong>(both complied and interpreted language)</strong><br>
